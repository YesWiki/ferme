Wakka / Wikini Installation


Not much to it (as long as it works, ahem). Unpack/upload the distribution files
into a directory that can be accessed via the web. Then go to the corresponding URL.
A web-based installer will walk you through the rest.

Example:

If your website, say, http://www.mysite.com, is mapped to the directory /home/jdoe/www/,
and you place the Wakka distribution files into /home/jdoe/www/wakka/, you should go to
http://www.mysite.com/wakka/.

Note that Wakka distributions normally unpack into directories that include the version
in their name; you'll probably want to rename those to just "wakka" -- or, if you're
on a unixoid system, set up a symbolic link.

IMPORTANT: for installing or upgrading Wakka, do NOT access any of the files contained
in the setup/ subdirectory. They're used by the web-based installer/updater, but you
should really just access the Wakka directory itself, and it will (or at least should)
work perfectly.
